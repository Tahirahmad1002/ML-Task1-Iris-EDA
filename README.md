# Task 1: Iris Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of my Machine Learning internship at **DeveloperHub Corporation**. The objective is to perform a comprehensive exploratory analysis of the Iris dataset to understand feature distributions and species separability.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Python 3.x**
* **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning.
* **Seaborn/Matplotlib**: Advanced data visualization.
* **Google Colab**: Development environment.

## 📊 Key Procedures
* **Data Validation**: Checked for null values and verified data types.
* **Statistical Analysis**: Analyzed mean, variance, and quartiles.
* **Feature Engineering Insight**: Identified that Petal Width/Length are the most significant features for classification.

## 📈 Visualizations Included
* **Pairplots**: Visualizing multi-dimensional relationships.
* **Box Plots**: Identifying statistical outliers in Sepal dimensions.
* **Histograms**: Analyzing the density and spread of individual features.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab.
2. Run all cells to generate the statistical reports and graphs.
